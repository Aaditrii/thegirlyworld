    <div class="sticky"><h1 style="color:pink;font-size:100px;" align="center">Problems Faced By Women</h1>
    <h3 align="center" style="color:white;font-size:20px;font-family:verdana">There are a lot of problems that are faced by women in the society.In earlier times,women were not even allowed in the kitchen during their menstruation period.Women were not allowed to even touch items like pickles or flowers.Although in urban areas,these beliefs have been reduced to a great extent but not finished.Today, even in this 21<sup>st</sup> century, these beliefs are followed in villages and traditional areas of India.Here are some of the listed problems which affect women most in the society.</h3><br/>
    <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:blue;" align="center">1.Female Molestation</h1><br/>
    <img  class="img1" src="molestation.jpg" alt="female molesation">
    <figcaption style="font-size:10px;font-family:verdana;" align="center">Source : internet</figcaption>
    <br/>
   <p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:20px" >Female molestation is one of the biggest problems of not only India but all over the world.According to a 23 year old study of NCBI,participants included 6 to 16-year-old females with substantiated sexual abuse and a demographically similar comparison group.
Every day in newspapers or by the means of any other media we listen about the sexual abuse chapters taking place in our surroundings.There are no regular and strong rules for such cases by our constitution even the culprits are given bail and they further harass the victims and their family to take back their case from the court.This keeps growing day by day.There have been many female sexual and molestation cases that took out breath of every girl in the past and present years.The problem is not with anyone but the problem is that the women are thought to be weak and dependent which is absolutely false.If we want a safer country then probably first a woman should know how to protect herself,her surroundings and her confidence.Many solutions can be suggested such as self defense,keeping safety items such as pepper spray etc with them.Also one should speak out and reach out such problems.</p>
<br/>
<h1 style="font-size:40px;color:blue" align="center">2.Female Infanticide</h1><br/>
    <img  class="img1" src="female_infanticide.jpg" alt="female Infanticide">
    <figcaption style="font-size:10px;font-family:verdana;" align="center">Source : internet</figcaption>
    <br/>
   <p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:20px;"> Female infanticide is also one of the biggest problems of India.Boys are considered as the king of the family and the extenders of family and girls are seen as a burden for parents,how cheap this sounds!!.Today well,these beliefs are not followed by most of the families but in many rural areas,this is followed till today.In India,checking the gender of the child before birth is illegal which is a strong and major step towards vanishing female infanticide.Truely said,a daughter is not a tension but she is equal to ten sons.A women can also be a successor of family and a girl can also alone take care of her family financially and economically.This concern should be spread as much as possible.There are many government schemes which support female birth such as Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana : (SSY),Balika Samridhi Yojana: (BSY) ,Mukhyamantri Rajshri Yojana (MRY) and many more .These schemes offers high interest rates as compared to other national schemes,tax savings etc.We all should also take care of our surroundings and try to stop these illegal practises such as female infanticide,child abuse as much as possible.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:blue" align="center">3.Dowry System</h1><br/>
    <img  class="img1" src="dowry.jpeg" alt="Dowry System">
    <figcaption style="font-size:10px;font-family:verdana;" align="center">Source : internet</figcaption>
    <br/>
   <p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:20px;"> Dowry refers to the bride's riches that are given to the groom and his family during marriage.This is such an irony that a women comes to other family and also brings money and other luxuries for that family.In many cases,if the bride's family is not able to meet the demands of the groom's family then either the marriage gets cancelled or the girl is torchured for whole life for not bringing the riches.Although this is illegal in India but  today also the groom's family indirectly ask for dowry and the bride's family is ready to pay because of their daughter's respect.Dowry includes money,furniture,land and many more.I sometimes think that how cheap would be the mind of that person or family who started all this means,a women is coming to a new house leaving her all relations behind and the family is asking money for her coming .Woman is not an item or a doll to be purchased or bought.Every woman has her independent right,her joy of living according to her,marrying on her own wishes.For reducing dowry system,I think women should be much educated to understand and stand against dowry,she should be financially self sufficient and confident so that if she faces such situations then she should take positive and right decision for her.</p><br/>
   <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:blue;" align="center">4.Domestic Violence</h1><br/>
    <img  class="img1" src="harrassment.jpg" alt="Domestic Violence">
    <figcaption style="font-size:10px;font-family:verdana;" align="center">Source : internet</figcaption>
    <br/>
     <p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:20px;">  Domestic violence refers to torchure done by males mostly on their wives or it can be vice versa too.As we learnt about dowry practice in above paragraph thay if the bride's family is not able to give riches to the groom's family,that women is torchured by her husband and his family which is the main cause of domestic violence.Drinking habits,frustration and negative mental health make the males to torchure females to such an extent that either those females die or commit suicide.A woman in a family also have equal rights such as man have.The other family members such as children and the parents are also affected by domestic violence.According to a National Family and Health Survey in 2005, total lifetime prevalence of domestic violence was 33.5% and 8.5% for sexual violence among women aged 15–49.There are many laws for prevention of domestic violence in india such as DOWRY PROHIBITION ACT in 1961.The most recent legislation is the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA) 2005. The PWDVA, a civil law, includes physical, emotional, sexual, verbal, and economic abuse as domestic violence.Many women hide domestic violence over them to save the names of their family and themselves and this is wrong.One should raise voice against the culprits such that no another woman faces such.</p><br/>
        <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:blue" align="center">How to finish??........</h1><br/>
                <h1 style="font-size:40px" align="center">1.Education</h1><br/>
               <p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:20px;">      Education and knowledge plays a powerful role in the upbringing of the society.The key to the freedom of women is education.The more educated a women is,the more she is aware about her rights and the more she is aware about the laws,no one can never bow her down.Women education will lead to the reduction of all the evils in this society.Kothari commission of 1968 recommended education as tool for social development.Also when a girl will gain equal education as compared to male then the gender inequality will be vanished.Also one of the major initiatives taken by government of india for education is <mark>BETI BACHAO,BETI PADHAO</mark> yojana(save daughter,educate daughter).This scheme was launched with an initial funding of ₹100 crore and mainly targets states like UttarPradesh,Bihar,Haryana etc.</p><br/>

<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:verdana;">2. Many of the wives stay with their husbands because of their financial dependency on husbands.But Azad Foundation trains women in professions closely related to them for achieving financial independence.Women undergo a half-year training course, which cover topics such as self-defense, women's rights, sexuality and reproductive rights, effective communication, grooming and most importantly, driving—their future vocation. The organization's founders have set up Sakha Consulting Wings Pvt. Ltd, a company that provides employment to these women and safe chauffeur and car hire services to other women.With the money raised through the show, Azad Foundation was able to strengthen its training and mobilization programmes, start new initiatives and build a corpus of funds to ensure the organization's sustainability. The funds raised also helped fortify the work of Sakha cabs, which increased its fleet from 7 to 11 cabs and the number of full-time women drivers from 8 to 13.
